##  ibf-unpack

Utility for packing and unpack `.ini` files from `ConfigINI.IBF` for Bioshock, Bioshock Remastered.

Also localization `Localizedint.lbf` archive supported too (for `.int` files with translated strings).

After unpack `.ini` files placed to `ContentBaked\pc\System` directory.

You need to rename `ConfigINI.IBF` or `Localizedint.lbf` after unpacking, because Vengeance Engine loads the `.ibf` and `.lbf` archives before files from `System` directory.
